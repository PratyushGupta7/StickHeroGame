- **Seamless Transitions:** Experience smooth transitions as the game seamlessly shifts between platforms, creating an immersive gaming loop.

### JUnit Tests

- **Test Serialization:** A JUnit test verifies the perfect serialization and deserialization of the game's data. A `DataBase` object is created with specific values for highest score and cherries. The object is written to a file and then read back. Assertions ensure that the read object matches the original, confirming proper serialization and deserialization.
- **Test Initialize Game Objects:** Another JUnit test ensures the proper initialization of game objects in the `WorldController`. The test checks if the `Character`, `Cherry`, and `Obstacle` objects are not null after initialization. This guarantees that the game starts with essential objects in a valid state.

### OOP Principles

- **Encapsulation:** Data and functionality are encapsulated within classes and attributes are accessed and modified through appropriate getters and setters, promoting clean and organized code.
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces are used to create a clear hierarchy of game entities, promoting code readability.
- **Polymorphism:** Different types of rewards and game entities utilize polymorphism to achieve flexibility and extensibility.
- **Inheritance:** Inheritance is employed to create specialized classes, enhancing code reuse and maintaining a structured class hierarchy.
- **Interfaces:** Interfaces are implemented to define common behaviors, promoting code consistency and adaptability.
